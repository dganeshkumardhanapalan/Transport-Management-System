reports for all the details of buses, collections, drivers, conductors, schedules, expenses and used to view the average performance of the drivers 
and conductors. This project helps the transport to get the updated details of the buses easily and frequently. It gives alerts for schedules like 
due dates, insurance, bus services, etc. These schedules are followed as per the date registered.
